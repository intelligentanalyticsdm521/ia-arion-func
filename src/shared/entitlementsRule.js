// src/shared/entitlementsRule.js — SEAM-3-B, and nothing else.
//
// arion-func's copy (added 2026-10-11 so the page voice score can ask maySpend
// before it spends on a model call). Copied from arion-api lib/entitlementsRule.js
// unchanged below this note; test/fixtures/entitlement-rule-cases.json is the
// same byte-identical fixture and test/entitlements-rule.test.mjs runs every case.
//
//   WHEN WE CANNOT DECIDE WHAT A BUSINESS BOUGHT:
//   ALLOW THE FEATURE. REFUSE THE SPEND.
//
// Both halves. They point in opposite directions, which is exactly why eight
// different files each picked one and the platform ended up answering the same
// question two ways:
//
//   * Refusing the FEATURE on an unknown answer is the 2026-08-17 incident.
//     Production never set OLIVER_API_BASE_URL, LUMEN's tier read returned
//     nothing, and every SPARK Pro/Business route 403'd for every tenant —
//     while the Portal, reading its tier elsewhere, showed the same features
//     unlocked. A customer must never see a locked door because of our outage.
//
//   * Allowing the SPEND on an unknown answer costs real money for a business
//     that may be on the free rung: an LLM judgement, a lead credit, an SMS
//     segment, a bought phone number. services/il/tier.js has failed closed on
//     purpose since it shipped, and it was right to.
//
// THIS FILE IS A DECLARED COPY. The same two functions exist byte-for-byte in
// platform-api lib/entitlements.js, LUMEN src/lib/entitlements.js, arion-api
// lib/entitlements.js and Portal src/lib/entitlements.ts, because there is no
// shared package across an ESM service, a CJS service, a Function App and a
// browser bundle (audit §10 / SEAM-9-A, October work).
//
// They cannot drift: test/fixtures/entitlement-rule-cases.json is BYTE-IDENTICAL
// in every one of those repos, every suite runs every case in it, and each repo
// has a mutation test that inverts one half and proves the suite goes red.
