// src/shared/productOwnership.js — "does this business have <product> switched on?",
// asked by every background job before it does work for a business.
//
// Scope: overnight-report/SCOPE_ACCESS_FOLLOWS_SUBSCRIPTION_2026-10-07.md §4.3
// ("Agents and timers stop"). When a business stops paying for a product, the
// product's API already refuses it (§4.1). The timers did not: the scheduled
// lead-gen dispatcher kept queueing paid lead searches, and kept emailing the
// "your run is in two days" notice, for a business whose SPARK had ended.
// Every runner now asks here, right after it has chosen its businesses, and
// leaves out the ones whose product is off.
//
// A DECLARED COPY of oliver-api lib/productOwnership.js (same rule, same SQL,
// same words), with LUMEN's ownedJsonOrNull and one addition: `deps.mssql`,
// because a verify script can hand this file a pool from LUMEN's own mssql
// copy (the dual-mssql gotcha leadgenScheduler.js describes).
//
// THE ANSWER comes from the same table every product gate reads:
// iadm_platform core.tenant_services (+ core.services, core.tenants).
//   ON   = a row for the product with is_enabled = 1 on an active service, or
//          the business is the platform owner or an agency (never switched off
//          by the subscription, scope §1.2).
//   OFF  = the business is known and has no such row. This is the same answer
//          the product's own API gives (LUMEN's requireSparkAccess row read):
//          a business the API refuses must not get its timers either.
//
// WHEN WE DO NOT KNOW, NOTHING CHANGES. (Brandon's standing rule for this build:
// never deny on "we don't know".) If the platform database cannot be read, if it
// answers with no rows at all for a non-empty question (a wrong database or a
// half-read looks like that), or if one business is missing from core.tenants,
// that business is KEPT and the runner runs exactly as it did before this file
// existed. The reason is logged at error so a person sees it. Decided here, and
// a departure from the scope's sketch ("skip that run"): see the stream-3
// report; flipping it is the one constant UNDECIDED_RUNS_AS_BEFORE.
//
// CACHE: decided answers only, 60 seconds per product and business. A failure is
// never cached, so the next tick asks again.
